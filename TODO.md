# TODO

## Essential

* Add a diff & delete function for local dirs
* Add this to box_fetch
* Make a fuss about the default overwrite/delete behaviors in the function 
documentation. 
* Add a one-line final operation summary catif statement for multi-file 
operations
* Add tests which cover:
    - The upload and download functions
    - The dir-wide operations

## Ideal

* Add better handling for restoring files/folders where the parent's missing
(or at least a warning)
* Build a vignette
* Try and implement an interactive online file selection tool

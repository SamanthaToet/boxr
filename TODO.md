# TODO

## Essential
* Get the creation and deletion of directories into the files list (you need to edit push & fetch)
* Make a fuss about the default overwrite/delete behaviors in the function 
documentation. 
* Write something very specfic about how you define when a file is 'new' vs. old (sha1 and timestamps)
* Add a one-line final operation summary catif statement for multi-file 
operations

## At some point
* Examples in the doc for the most important functions
* See also, etc

## Ideal
* Build a vignette
* Try and implement an interactive online file selection tool

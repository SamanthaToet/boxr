# TODO

## Essential

* Add deleting directories to the git-verbs
* Make a fuss about the default overwrite/delete behaviors in the function documentation. 
* Fix the catif statements when used for scanning directories
* Add a one-line final operation summary catif statement for multi-file operations
* Add tests which cover:
    - The upload and download functions
    - The dir-wide operations

## Ideal

* Add better handling for restoring files/folders where the parent's missing
* Build a vignette
* Try and implement an interactive online file selection tool

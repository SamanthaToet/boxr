# Notes on testing

Unfortunately, there isn't a secure, generaly-accepted way of doing OAuth2.0 for open continuous integration.

As a result, for the time being, these tests are run locally before pushing to Github. They're also written to be run from `tests/testthat` (as happens when you run `devtools::test()`), as opposed to a temporary directory (as per `devtools::check()`).

## Prerequisites
The following files in the root of the repo:

* `.client_secret` Plain-text
* `.client_id` Plain-text
* `.boxr-oauth` As generated by `box_auth()`

Note: The tests will delete everything in the account, and fill it full of dummy files many times. Do not test with an account containing important files.

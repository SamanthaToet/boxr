Description: An R interface for the remote file hosting service 'Box' 
  (https://www.box.com/). In addition to uploading and downloading files, this
  package includes functions which mirror base R operations for local files, 
  (e.g. box_load(), box_save(), box_read(), box_setwd(), etc.), as well as 'git'
  style functions for entire directories (e.g. box_fetch(), box_push()).

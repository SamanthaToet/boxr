\item{local_dir}{A file path to a local directory which you'd like the file
to be downloaded to.}

\item{filename}{The filename for the local version of the file. The default,
\code{NULL}, uses the name from box.com.}

\item{file}{the path to the local file that you'd like to upload (if there is
one)}

\item{dir_id}{If uploading, the box.com folder id that you'd like to upload
to.}

\description{
\code{box_dl} takes the \code{id} of a file hosted on box.com, downloads
it and writes it to disk.
}
\details{
\code{box_read} does the same, but reads it into memory as an \code{R}
object. This can be useful, for example, to read a \code{.csv} file into
memory as a \code{\link{data.frame}}.

\code{box_ul} uploads a file stored locally to a specified box.com folder.
If a file with the same name already exists, it will store a new version of
the file.
